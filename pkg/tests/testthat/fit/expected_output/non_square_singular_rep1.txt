Fit Error - D matrix is rank deficient (the inverse condition is exactly zero).
Derivatives of fit targets are dependent or
for one or more fit targets all derivatives are (almost) zero ...
Tip: try to use svd analysis and/or fit option 'warn_zero_col'. See documentation of method set_fit_options.

*** SVD analysis ***
=======================
The purpose of the SVD analysis is to find linearly dependent rows or columns
of the fit jacobian.
A left singular vector is a linear combination of the rows of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
A right singular vector is a linear combination of the columns of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
Only components >=   0.15E-07  are shown.

Left Singular vectors:
-----------------------
Singular value X
                              w1 -0.71
                              w2  0.71

Right Singular vectors:
----------------------
Singular value X
                              x1 -0.82
                              x2  0.41
                              x3  0.41


The singularity may also be caused by (almost) zero rows or columns.
Therefore we print the norm of "problem rows" and "problem columns"
(rows and columns with significant components in left and right singular vectors resp.)

Problem rows:
-----------------
                        Variable     L1 norm of row
                              w1   3.0
                              w2   3.0

Problem columns:
-------------
                        Variable  L1 norm of column
                              x1   2.0
                              x2   2.0
                              x3   2.0
