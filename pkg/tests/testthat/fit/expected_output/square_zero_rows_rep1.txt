Fit Warning - D matrix is ill conditioned.
Inverse condition= xxx < Machine prec**.5= xxx
Derivatives of fit targets are dependent or
for one or more fit targets all derivatives are (almost) zero ...
Tip: try to use svd analysis and/or fit option 'warn_zero_col'. See documentation of method set_fit_options.
 
*** SVD analysis ***
=======================
The purpose of the SVD analysis is to find linearly dependent rows or columns
of the fit jacobian.
A left singular vector is a linear combination of the rows of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
A right singular vector is a linear combination of the columns of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
Only components >=  xxx  are shown.
 
Left Singular vectors:
-----------------------
Singular value  xxx
                              w2  xxx
 
Right Singular vectors:
----------------------
Singular value  xxx
                              x1 xxx
                              x2 xxx
                              x3 xxx
                              x4 xxx
                              x5 xxx
                              x6 xxx
 
 
The singularity may also be caused by (almost) zero rows or columns.
Therefore we print the norm of "problem rows" and "problem columns"
(rows and columns with significant components in left and right singular vectors resp.)
 
Problem rows:
-----------------
                        Variable     L1 norm of row
                              w2 xxx
 
Problem columns:
-------------
                        Variable  L1 norm of column
                              x1  xxx
                              x2 xxx
                              x3  xxx
                              x4  xxx
                              x5  xxx
