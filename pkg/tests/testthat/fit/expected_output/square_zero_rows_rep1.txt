Warning: Derivatives of fit target w2 are almost zero. L1-norm:   0.10E-08
Fit Warning - D matrix is ill conditioned.
Inverse condition=  2.67E-10 < Machine prec**.5=  1.49E-08
Derivatives of fit targets are dependent or
for one or more fit targets all derivatives are (almost) zero ...
Tip: try to use svd analysis and/or fit option 'warn_zero_col'. See documentation of method set_fit_options.
