Error: All derivatives of fit target w2 are exactly zero.
Warning: Derivatives of fit target w3 are almost zero. L1-norm:
Fit Error - D matrix is rank deficient (the inverse condition is exactly zero).
Derivatives of fit targets are dependent or
for one or more fit targets all derivatives are (almost) zero ...
Tip: try to use svd analysis and/or fit option 'warn_zero_row' or warn_zero_col'.
