 ISIS model compilation : complex

 Model reference table

 Each variable name is followed by its
 maximum lag (with minus sign) and maximum lead in the model,
 its type:  E(xogenous), B(ehavioral), I(dentity).
 Exogenous variables listed first.

 Parameters are listed separately.
 Each parameter name is followed by its length.

 Equations are listed in solution order,
 followed by a list of feedback variables.
