*** SVD analysis ***
=======================
The purpose of the SVD analysis is to find linearly dependent rows or columns
in the jacobian
A left singular vector is a linear combination of the rows of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
A right singular vector is a linear combination of the columns of the jacobian
that is (almost) zero.
Only components >=             are shown.

Left Singular vectors:
----------------------
Singular value X
                              x1
                              y1

Right Singular vectors:
-----------------------
Singular value X
                              x1
                              y1
                              p1


The singularity may also be caused by (almost) zero rows or columns.
Therefore we print the norm of "problem rows" and "problem columns"
(rows and columns with significant components in left and right singular vectors resp.)

Problem rows:
-------------
                        Variable     L1 norm of row
                              x1
                              y1

Problem columns:
----------------
                        Variable  L1 norm of column
                              x1
                              y1
                              p1
