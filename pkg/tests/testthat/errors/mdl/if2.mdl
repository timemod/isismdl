? if statements with type mismatch (logical and reals mixed).
? error should be detected by readmdl

ident x1 = if (x) then 2 else 2;
ident x2 = if (3 .or. 2) then 2 else 2;
ident x3 = if (3 = 2) then 2 else 2 = 4;
ident x4 = if (.not. 2) then 2 else 3;
ident x5 = if (x = 2) then 2 else (3 + (2 = 1));

? the next equation does not result in an error:
? the logical value is convert to a number
ident x6 = 3 = 2;
