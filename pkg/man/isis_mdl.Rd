\title{Creates an \code{\link{IsisMdl}} object from a model file.}
\usage{
isis_mdl(model_file, period, data, ca, fix_values, fit_targets)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_file}{The name of the model file.
An extension \code{mdl} is appended to the specified name if the filename
does not already have an extension}

\item{period}{a \code{\link[regts]{regperiod_range}} object}

\item{data}{the model data as a  \code{\link[regts]{regts}} object with column
names}

\item{ca}{the constant adjustments as a  \code{\link[regts]{regts}} object
with column names}

\item{fix_values}{the fix values as a  \code{\link[regts]{regts}} object
with column names}

\item{fit_targets}{the fit targets as a  \code{\link[regts]{regts}} object
with column names}
}
\description{
This function creates an \code{\link{IsisMdl}} object.
A model as defined on an external ASCII file is analysed and
compiled into an internal code. This internal model code is
written to a file with extension \code{mif} containing equation
and variable information.
}
\details{
The file containing the model must have an extension \code{mdl}.
The compiled model is \emph{not} kept in memory. The function
\code{\link{read_mdl}} should be called to load the model for immediate
use.

In addition, some technical information about the model and a
cross reference of the model is written
to an external file with extension \code{mrf}.
For each variable its maximum lag and lead are given and a list
of equations (by name) in which it occurs.

The compiler also orders the equations of the model into three
separate blocks

\itemize{
\item
the \emph{pre-recursive} block  containing equations
which can be solved recursively from exogenous and lagged
variables only.
\item
the \emph{simultaneous} block containing all equations
with interdependent endogenous variables.
\item
the \emph{post-recursive} block containing equations
which can be solved recursively once the two previous blocks
have been solved.
}
The ordering process also provides a list of so-called feedback
variables, i.e. variables whose value must be assumed known to
make the \emph{simultaneous} block recursive.
Initial guesses for these variables must be provided in order to
solve a model.
If a model has no feedback variables, it is a recursive model (it
can be solved in one pass through the equations).

If the compiler encounters errors in the model, these are written
to a file with an extension \code{err}.
All generated files have the same basename as the model file.
